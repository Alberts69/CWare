# CWare
Simple program to convert Windows EXE files to MacOS APP files.

(Note: Not all EXE files will successfully convert to APP files. Some may be buggy or will not work properly/at all.)

If you want to turn an EXE file into an APP file, pull an request. Max file size I can convert is 150MB or less.

As of right now it only works with Intel based laptops only. Does not work on M1 Macs. Also, I do not have a public software for converting this yet. I am still working on it. Only works on MacOS Sierra to Big sur (10.12 - 11.5 Beta 2).

Current things that are being worked on: M1 Mac Support, Support for more applications.
