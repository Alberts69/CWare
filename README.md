# CWare
Simple program to convert Windows EXE files to MacOS APP files.

(Note: Not all EXE files will successfully convert to APP files. Some may be buggy or will not work properly/at all.)

If you want to turn an EXE file into an APP file, pull an request. Max file size I can convert is 150MB or less.

ConvertWare/CWare

As of right now it only works with Intel based laptops only. Still working on M1 Macs. Also, I haven't got an application to convert this yet because I am still working on it. Thanks for your patience.
