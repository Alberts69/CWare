Simple program to convert Windows EXE files to MacOS APP files.

(Note: Not all EXE files will successfully convert to APP files. Some may be buggy or will not work properly/at all.)

If you want to turn an EXE file into an APP file, pull an request. Max file size I can convert is 150MB or less.

As of right now it only works with Intel based laptops only. Still working on M1 Macs. Also, I do not have a public software for converting this yet. I am still working on it. Only works on MacOS High Sierra to Big sur (10.13 - 11.4B). I am still working on making it support MacOS 10.12 and lower. Thanks for your patience.

Change Log:
May 4th 2021 - 1.0 - Initial version


May 4th 2021 - 1.0.1 - Fixed applications that only load halfway


Current things that are being worked on: M1 Mac Support, Support for more applications, Access to microphone, download folder, etc request. (Some applications need those to function. I am currently working on it for that.), Sierra and below support, and a software to convert it so I don't have to do it for you guys.
